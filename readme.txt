== Frequently Asked Questions ==
If you've got any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

= Why do I need to upload posts featured images of same size? =

* This plugin uses the posts featured thumbnail images in the showcase section. So if you upload same size images, height and width of the showcase section for the images will be same and so that will give the better look. 
* **Go to the plugin settings page and see if there are any notifications**

= How can I display services as a showcase on the frontend? =

* You can add the custom post type as services and then from settings page of wp posts showcase select the post type as services and then select desired services from posts dropdown to display them on frontend.
